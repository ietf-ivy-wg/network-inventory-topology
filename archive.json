If the intention of this grouping/container is to have a place holder for some configuration parameters , I do not think the name is good since it seems related to \"schema mount\" as it seems not the case. Frankly speaking the YANG description does not help too much to understand the scope so my proposal would be:\r\n\r\n  **1.  Improve the description\r\n  2.  Change the name consequently to the new description**\r\n\r\nSergio, 01 August 2024\r\n\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/inventory-yang/49iY8eTKBS65XhEIamyFp0P8TuQ/\r\n\r\n",

The comparison conclusion should be added that the modeling approach in CCAMP WG I-D seems redundant and causes these duplicate nodes at each layer. Defining a new \"network-types\" can avoid this and can be flexibly combined with other  layer topologies.\r\n\r\n**2)      What is the purpose of the node-name?**\r\n\r\nIf it is intended to report the system-hostname, let's consider whether this attribute belongs to this model or to the network-element in the inventory model.
