If the intention of this grouping/container is to have a place holder for some configuration parameters , I do not think the name is good since it seems related to \"schema mount\" as it seems not the case. Frankly speaking the YANG description does not help too much to understand the scope so my proposal would be:\r\n\r\n  **1.  Improve the description\r\n  2.  Change the name consequently to the new description**\r\n\r\nSergio, 01 August 2024\r\n\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/inventory-yang/49iY8eTKBS65XhEIamyFp0P8TuQ/\r\n\r\n",

The comparison conclusion should be added that the modeling approach in CCAMP WG I-D seems redundant and causes these duplicate nodes at each layer. Defining a new \"network-types\" can avoid this and can be flexibly combined with other  layer topologies.\r\n\r\n**2)      What is the purpose of the node-name?**\r\n\r\nIf it is intended to report the system-hostname, let's consider whether this attribute belongs to this model or to the network-element in the inventory model.

I think the model looks quite straightforward. We can clarify this if you think it's necessary\n\nSee: https://github.com/ietf-ivy-wg/network-inventory-topology/issues/2#issuecomment-2644718138\n\nThis is the text in the [draft-ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang/) I was mentioning:\n\n> Network topology is a logical abstraction based on hardware inventory objects. The abstraction may be based on technology requirements (e.g., layer 0 or layer 1 resources) or on some specific requirements (e.g., for path computation or service provisioning).\n> \n> Therefore the relationship between hardware inventory objects and network topology objects can be 1:N (N>=1).\n> \n> Taking the Optical technology as example, an Optical Transport Network (OTN) Network Element (NE) can be installed with several kinds of boards, including an Ethernet client signal switching board, a line board which is used for OTN layer switching. This line board may also be used as a starting point for the WDM layer. In terms of technologies, this OTN NE supports multi-layer network topology connections, so that it should appear in L0, L1 and L2 network topology.\n\nAs described in section 3.2:\n\n> A TE node represents one or several nodes, or a fraction of a node, which can be a switch or router that is physical or virtual.\n\nMy understanding is that the question of Aihua was how to navigate from an abstract node which is supported by multiple physical NEs and the physical NEs.\n\nI am noting that the current text in [draft-ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang/) is not as explicit as I though and we have discussed: https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/issues/33#issuecomment-1323894609\n\nIn a nutshell, each node in the network inventory topology maps with a single physical NE in the network inventory. The association between the abstract node and the physical NEs is described by associating the abstract node with the corresponding nodes in the network inventory topology. The underlay topology relationship has been already defined in RFC 8795 for this purpose.\n\nThe 1:N association was described to cover the case where a NE supports nodes in different layers (e.g., an OTN node in the OTN topology and a WDM node in the WDM topology).\n\nThinking further, we can follow the same approach above and define only a 1:1 mapping between the nodes in the network inventory topology and the physical NEs in the network inventory. The association between the OTN and WDM nodes and the physical NE can be described by associating the OTN and WDM nodes with the corresponding node in the network inventory topology. \n\nI think some text clarifying these two points would be useful for the readers and implementers.\n",
