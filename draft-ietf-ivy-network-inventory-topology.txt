          A Network Data Model for Inventory Topology Mapping
            draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG model to map the network inventory data
   with the topology model to form a base underlay network.  The model
   facilitates the correlation between the layer (e.g., Layer 2 and
   Layer 3) topology information and the inventory data of the underlay
   network for better service provisioning, network maintenance
   operations, and other assessment scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] defines the base network
   inventory model to aggregate the inventory data of Network Elements
   (NEs).  This data includes identification of these NEs and their
   hardware, firmware, and software components.  Examples of inventory
   hardware components could be rack, shelf, slot, board, or physical
   port.  Examples of inventory software components could be platform
   Operating System (OS), software-patches, bios, or boot- loader
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software].

   In order to ease navigation from/to inventory and network topologies,
   this document extends the network topology model [RFC8345] for
   network inventory mapping: "ietf-network-inventory-topology"
   (Section 5).  This model provides a mechanism for the correlation
   with existing network and topology models, such as "A YANG Network
   Data Model for Service Attachment Points (SAPs)" [RFC9408], "A YANG
   Data Model for Layer 2 Network Topologies" [RFC8944], and "A YANG
   Data Model for Layer 3 Topologies" [RFC8346].

   The network inventory topology mapping data model ("ietf-network-
   inventory-topology") also provides anchor points to mount specific
   device configuration and state information, e.g., Quality of Service
   (QoS) and Access Control List (ACL) policies, to support
   configuration verification of policies at the network level.  Further
   sample uses are discussed in Section 3.

   Similar to the base inventory model
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang], the network inventory topology
   does not make any assumption about involved network elements and
   their roles in topologies.  As such, the mapping model can be applied
   indepent of the network type (optical local loops, access network,
   core network, etc.) and application.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].

3.  Sample Use Cases of the Data Model

3.1.  Determine Available Resources of Service Attachment Points (SAPs)

   The inventory topology model can be used as a base to correlate
   underlay information, such as physical port components.  Figure 1
   exemplifies this usage.

   During service provisioning, to check available physical port
   resources, the SAPs information can be associated with the underlay
   inventory information and interface information associated with the
   inventory topology, e.g., "parent-termination-point" of SAP Model can
   be associated with the "port-component-ref" and "interface-name" of
   the inventory topology model, which can be used to check the
   availability and capacity of physical ports.

3.2.  "What-if" Scenarios

   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] defines Network Digital
   Twin (NDT) as a virtual representation of the physical network.  Such
   representation is meant to be used to analyze, diagnose, emulate, and
   then manage the physical network based on data, models, and
   interfaces.

   The management system can use NDT to build multi-layer topology maps
   for networks and endpoints with relationship types and dependencies,
   and identify potential impacts on configuration management
   information from incidents, problems, and changes.  More generally,
   the inventory topology model can be used as part of the SIMAP
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept].

   The inventory topology model can, for example, be used to emulate
   several "what-if" scenarios such as the impact of End of Life (EOL)
   or depletion of a hardware component (chipset) on the network
   resilience and service availability.

4.  Module Tree Structure

   An overview of the structure of the "ietf-network-inventory-topology"
   module is shown in Figure 2.

      module: ietf-network-inventory-topology
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
          +--rw network-inventory-mapping!
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--ro ne-ref?                  ne-ref
             +--rw policies-target-point
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--ro cable-name?   string
             +--ro link-type?    string
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--ro port-component-ref?      leafref
             +--ro interface-name*          string
             +--rw policies-target-point

    Figure 2: The Structure of the Network Inventory Mapping Data Model

   The module augments the "ietf-network-topology" module as follows:

   *  A new network topology type: "network-inventory-mapping".  The
      corresponding container augments the "network-types" of the "ietf-
      network" module.

   *  Inventory mapping attributes for nodes, links, and termination
      points: The corresponding containers augments the topology module
      with the references to the base network inventory, references to
      interface management, and policy mount points

      The inventory topology model associates inventory data with
      overlay topologies.  It can be used as the "supporting-networks"
      of SAP, Layer 2, or Layer 3 topologies.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-network-inventory-topology" YANG module defines a data
   model that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management
   protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These
   protocols have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252],
   TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC {{?RFC9000]) and have to use mutual
   authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
   nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
   have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   'ne-ref':  The reference may be used to track the set of network
      elements.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory-topology
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group:

   Name:  ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Prefix:  nwit
   Maintained by IANA?  N
   Reference:  RFC XXXX
