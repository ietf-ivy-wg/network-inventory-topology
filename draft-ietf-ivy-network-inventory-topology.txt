                   A Network Inventory Topology Model
            draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG model for network inventory topology to
   correlate the network inventory data with the general topology model
   to form a base underlay network, which can facilitate the mapping and
   correlation of the layer (e.g.  Layer 2, Layer 3) topology
   information above to the inventory data of the underlay network for
   agile service provisioning and network maintenance analysis.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] defines base Network Inventory
   (NI) model to aggregate the inventory data of the Network Elements
   (NEs) on the network, which includes NEs and their hardware
   components, firmware components, and software components.  Examples
   of inventory hardware components could be rack, shelf, slot, board
   and physical port.  Examples of inventory software components could
   be platform operating system (OS), software-patch, bios, and boot-
   loader.

   This document extends the [RFC8345] network topology model for
   network inventory mapping, which facilitates the correlation with
   existing network and topology models, such as SAP [RFC9408], L2
   topology [RFC8944], and L3 topology [RFC8346], to support agile
   service provisioning and network maintenance.

   In addition, the network inventory topology can also provide anchor
   points to mount specific device configuration and state information,
   e.g.  QoS policies, ACL policies, to support configuration
   verification of cross-domain policies.

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

3.  Sample Use Cases of the Data Model

3.1.  Determine Available Resource of Service Attachment Points (SAPs)

   The inventory topology model can be used as a base to correlate
   underlay information, such as physical port components.  The figure
   belows gives an example of the usage.

   During service provisioning, to check available physical port
   resources, the Service Attachment Points (SAPs) information can be
   associated with the underlay inventory information and interface
   information associated with the inventory topology, e.g.  "parent-
   termination-point" of SAP Model can be associated with the "port-
   component-ref" and "interface-name" of the inventory topology model,
   which can be used to check the availability and capacity of physical
   ports.

          Figure 1: An Example Usage of Network Inventory Topology

3.2.  The Example Digital Twin Network

   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] defines "digital twin
   network" as a virtual representation of the physical network.  Such
   virtual representation of the network is meant to be used to analyze,
   diagnose, emulate, and then manage the physical network based on
   data, models, and interfaces.

   The management system can use digital twin technology to build visual
   multi-layer topology maps for networks and endpoints with
   relationship types and dependencies, and identify potential impacts
   on configuration management information from incidents, problems, and
   changes.

   The inventory topology model can, for example, be used to emulate
   several what-if scenario such as the impact of EOL or depletion of a
   hardware component on the network resilience and service
   availability.

4.  Module Tree Structure

   An overview of the data model for "ietf-network-inventory-topology"
   module are shown in Figure 2.

      module: ietf-network-inventory-topology
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
          +--rw network-inventory-mapping!
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--ro ne-ref?                  ne-ref
             +--rw policies-target-point
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--ro cable-name?   string
             +--ro link-type?    string
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--ro port-component-ref?      leafref
             +--ro interface-name*          string
             +--rw policies-target-point

    Figure 2: The Structure of the Network Inventory Mapping Data Model

   The module augments the original "ietf-network- topology" modules as
   follows:

   *  A new network topology type: "network-inventory-mapping".  The
      corresponding container augments the network-types of the "ietf-
      network" module.

   *  Inventory mapping attributes for nodes, links, and termination
      points: The corresponding containers augments the topology module
      with the references to the base network inventory, references to
      interface management, and system mount points

      Being an independent underlaying topology, the inventory topology
      model associates inventory data with overlay topologies.  It can
      be used as the "supporting-networks" of SAP, Layer 2, or Layer 3
      topologies.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section uses the template described in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular
   sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   'ne-ref':  The reference may be used to track the set of network
      elements.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory-topology
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group:

   Name:  ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Prefix:  nwit
   Maintained by IANA?  N
   Reference:  RFC XXXX
