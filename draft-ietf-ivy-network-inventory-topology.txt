        A YANG Network Data Model for Inventory Topology Mapping
            draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model to map the network inventory
   data with the topology data to form a base underlay network.  The
   data model facilitates the correlation between the layer (e.g., Layer
   2 or Layer 3) topology information and the inventory data of the
   underlay network for better service provisioning, network maintenance
   operations, and other assessment scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] defines the base network
   inventory model to aggregate the inventory data of Network Elements
   (NEs).  This data includes identification of these NEs and their
   hardware, firmware, and software components.  Examples of inventory
   hardware components could be rack, shelf, slot, board, or physical
   port.  Examples of inventory software components could be platform
   Operating System (OS), software-modules, bios, or boot-loader
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-software].

   In order to ease navigation from (or to) inventory and network
   topologies, this document extends the network topology data model
   [RFC8345] for network inventory mapping: "ietf-network-inventory-
   topology" (Section 5).  This data model provides a mechanism for the
   correlation with existing network and topology data models, such as
   "A YANG Network Data Model for Service Attachment Points (SAPs)"
   [RFC9408], "A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Network Topologies"
   [RFC8944], and "A YANG Data Model for Layer 3 Topologies" [RFC8346].

   Similar to the base inventory data model
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang], the network inventory topology
   does not make any assumption about involved NEs and their roles in
   topologies.  As such, the mapping model can be applied independent of
   the network type (optical local loops, access network, core network,
   etc.) and application.

   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].

3.  Sample Use Cases of the Data Model

3.1.  Determine Available Resources of Service Attachment Points (SAPs)

   The inventory topology data model can be used as a basis for
   correlating underlay information, such as physical port components.
   Figure 1 exemplifies this usage.

   During service provisioning, to check available physical port
   resources, the SAPs information can be associated with the underlay
   inventory information and interface information associated with the
   inventory topology, e.g., "parent-termination-point" of SAP Model can
   be associated with the "port-component-ref" of the inventory topology
   data model, which can be used to check the availability and capacity
   of physical ports.

3.2.  "What-if" Scenarios

   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] defines Network Digital
   Twin (NDT) as a virtual representation of the physical network.  Such
   representation is meant to be used to analyze, diagnose, emulate, and
   then manage the physical network based on data, models, and
   interfaces.

   [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] defines Service and Infrastructure Maps
   (SIMAP) as an abstraction model that provides a unified view of both
   service and infrastructure information, enabling correlation between
   service requirements and underlying resource capabilities.

   Both architectures require accurate mapping between logical network
   topology and physical inventory as a foundational data layer.  This
   model provides the essential physical resource information to such
   systems, enabling them to perform accurate "what-if" analysis (e.g.,
   impact prediction of hardware EOL, path re-optimization under
   resource constraints, service availability assessment).

4.  Module Tree Structure

   An overview of the structure of the "ietf-network-inventory-topology"
   module is shown in Figure 2.

      module: ietf-network-inventory-topology
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--rw ne-ref?   nwi:ne-ref
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--rw link-type?   string
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
          +--rw inventory-mapping-attributes
             +--rw ne-ref?          nwi:ne-ref
             +--rw port-ref?        leafref
             +--ro port-breakout!
                +--ro breakout-channel* [channel-id]
                   +--ro channel-id    uint16

    Figure 2: The Structure of the Network Inventory Mapping Data Model

   The module defines two features "inventory-to-topology-navigate" and
   "topology-to-inventory-navigate" to control the navigation direction
   (from topology to inventory and vice versa).

   The module augments the "ietf-network-topology" module as follows:

   *  Inventory mapping attributes for nodes, links, and termination
      points: The corresponding containers augments the topology module
      with the references to the base network inventory

      The inventory topology model associates inventory data with
      overlay topologies.  It can be used as the "supporting-networks"
      of SAP, Layer 2, or Layer 3 topologies.

4.1.  Link Extensions

   This document adds a lightweight "link-type" leaf to the topology
   link mapping to enable basic physical media classification.

   *  "link-type" – A string indicating the link media type, such as
      "copper", "fiber", or "coax".  For wireless media, values such as
      "microwave", or "wifi" may be used

   The "link-type" serves as a lightweight discriminator that guides to
   the appropriate specialized inventory model for detailed resource
   information.  For example, wired media (fiber, copper) typically
   reference a passive network inventory model, such as the one defined
   in [I-D.ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory].

4.2.  Port-Breakout Capability

   High-density Ethernet ports (e.g., 400 Gb/s DR4) can be split into
   multiple independent lower-speed channels.  The breakout channels
   represent the intrinsic capability of the port to be partitioned,
   regardless of whether the port is currently configured as a trunk or
   as a breakout port.

   A trunk port is associated with exactly one physical interface.  A
   breakout port is a port that is decomposed into two or more physical
   interfaces; those interfaces may run at the same or different speeds
   and may consume the same or a different number of breakout channels.

   The container "port-breakout" is added under the termination-point
   augmentation.  It lists the logical channels into which the single
   physical port can be divided.  Only termination-points whose parent
   port is breakout-capable need to instantiate the container; otherwise
   the container is omitted, keeping the topology model minimal for the
   common non-breakout case.

   Breakout channel is an atomic resource element obtained by
   partitioning a breakout port.  One physical interface may be
   associated with one or more breakout channels, but one breakout
   channel MUST NOT be associated with more than one physical interface.
   Appendix B provides example configurations.

   It is assumed that a port which supports breakout can be configured
   either as a trunk port or as a breakout port.  Interface
   channelisation (e.g., VLAN sub-interfaces) is outside the scope of
   this document and is addressed by the Layer 2 network topology model
   [RFC8944].

6.  Operational Considerations

   This model enables a network controller to report discovered network
   topology and inventory information.  Automatic discovery serves as
   the primary mechanism, with selective configuration capabilities
   provided for scenarios where discovery is not feasible.

   For typical operations such as service provisioning and network
   planning, the model offers read-only query access to authoritative
   mappings between logical topology and physical inventory.  The
   inventory-mapping-attributes containers are defined as read-write
   (config true) to accommodate cases where automatic discovery is not
   possible, including:

   *  Customer-premises equipment (CPE) outside the operator's
      management domain

   *  Leased lines and third-party transport resources

   *  Planned or hypothetical resources for future deployment

   In these cases, the operator manually configures the mapping to
   maintain accurate topology-to-inventory correlation.

   The following nodes are read-only (config false) as they represent
   hardware-determined state:

   port-breakout: Hardware capability determined by physical port
   characteristics

   The "ietf-network-inventory-topology" YANG module defines a data
   model that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management
   protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These
   YANG-based management (1) have to use a secure transport layer (e.g.,
   SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC {{?RFC9000]) and (2) have to
   use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) and delete operations to these data nodes without proper
   protection or authentication can have a negative effect on network
   operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes have particular
   sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   'ne-ref', 'port-ref', 'link-type': These nodes are sensitive as they
   establish the mapping between logical topology and physical
   inventory.  Unauthorized modification could lead to incorrect
   resource allocation or service disruption.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   'ne-ref': The references may be used to track the set of network
   elements.  While read-only, they may reveal network infrastructure
   details.

   'port-breakout': This node exposes hardware capabilities.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory-topology
      Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
      XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group:

   Name:  ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-inventory-topology
   Prefix:  nwit
   Maintained by IANA?  N
   Reference:  RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  "link-type" Usage Examples

   This appendix provides examples illustrating the usage of the link-
   type data node.

   Scenario: Device SW-1 and device SW-2 are directly connected by a
   fiber.

   Physical topology:

   +--------+                                    +--------+
   |        |                                    |        |
   | [SW-1] +========= fiber link ===============+ [SW-2] |
   |        |                                    |        |
   +--------+                                    +--------+

Appendix B.  JSON Example of an MPO Breakout-Channel Port

   This appendix provides an example of a 400 Gb/s DR4 port that is
   physically implemented as four independent 100 Gb/s lanes (an MPO
   breakout).  The lanes are exposed as breakout-channel entries so that
   the port can later be configured as either a single 400G trunk or
   four 100G breakout interfaces.  The instance data below shows the
   minimal JSON encoding [RFC7951] of the "port-breakout" container for
   this port.
